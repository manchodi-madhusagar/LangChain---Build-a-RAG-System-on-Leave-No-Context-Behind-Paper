A key component in our proposed approach is a new at-\\ntention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates\\na compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds\\nin both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms\\nin a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\\napproach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence\\nlength passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization\\ntasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded\\nmemory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.\\n1 Introduction\\nMemory serves as a cornerstone of intelligence, as it enables efficient computations tailored\\nto specific contexts. However, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and Transformer-based\\nLLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Groeneveld et al., 2024) have\\na constrained context-dependent memory, due to the nature of the attention mechanism.\\nUpdate \\nVVConcat Concat \\nQ V\\nQ V\\nQs{KV}sCompressive memory & \\nLinear attention Causal scaled dot-product \\nattention & PE Linear \\nprojection \\n{KV}s-1Retrieve \\nFigure 1: Infini-attention has an addi-\\ntional compressive memory with linear\\nattention for processing infinitely long\\ncontexts. {KV}s−1and{KV}sare atten-\\ntion key and values for current and previ-\\nous input segments, respectively and Qs\\nthe attention queries. PE denotes position\\nembeddings.The attention mechanism in Transformers ex-\\nhibits quadratic complexity in both memory\\nfootprint and computation time. For example,\\nthe attention Key-Value (KV) states have 3TB\\nmemory footprint for a 500B model with batch\\nsize 512 and context length 2048 (Pope et al.,\\n2023). Indeed, scaling LLMs to longer sequences\\n(i.e. 1M tokens) is challenging with the standard\\nTransformer architectures and serving longer\\nand longer context models becomes costly finan-\\ncially.\\nCompressive memory systems promise to be\\nmore scalable and efficient than the attention\\nmechanism for extremely long sequences (Kan-\\nerva, 1988; Munkhdalai et al., 2019). Instead\\nof using an array that grows with the input se-\\nquence length, a compressive memory primarily\\nmaintains a fixed number of parameters to store\\nand recall information with a bounded storage\\nand computation costs. In the compressive mem-\\nory, new information is added to the memory\\nby changing its parameters with an objective\\nthat this information can be recovered back later\\non. However, the LLMs in their current state\\nhave yet to see an effective, practical compres-\\nsive memory technique that balances simplicity along with quality.\\n1arXiv:2404.07143v1  [cs.CL]  10 Apr

Incorporating Sparsity:**\n\n*   As mentioned in the context, introducing sparsity into the attention layer has proven effective in improving efficiency (Chen et al., 2023b; Ratner et al., 2022; Mohtashami & Jaggi, 2024). EICT could explore incorporating similar sparsity mechanisms to reduce computational overhead and memory footprint.\n\n**2. Leveraging Specific Hardware Architecture:**\n\n*   The context highlights system-level optimization techniques that exploit specific hardware architecture for efficient attention computation (Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). EICT could investigate similar optimizations tailored to its specific hardware environment to maximize performance gains.\n\n**3. Exploring Alternative Position Encoding Methods:**\n\n*   While position interpolation techniques offer data efficiency, they still present cost challenges during inference. EICT could explore alternative position encoding methods that strike a better balance between efficiency and accuracy. This might involve investigating methods beyond those mentioned in the context, such as learned positional embeddings or relative positional encodings.\n\n**4. Hybrid Approaches:**\n\n*   Combining elements from different optimization techniques could lead to synergistic improvements. For instance, EICT could explore a hybrid approach that integrates sparsity with hardware-specific optimizations or combines position encoding modifications with other efficiency techniques. \n\n**5. Dynamic Attention Mechanisms:**\n\n*   EICT could investigate the use of dynamic attention mechanisms that adjust the attention calculation based on the input data. This could involve focusing attention on the most relevant parts of the input sequence, further improving efficiency and potentially enhancing accuracy.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n*   **Quantization:** Techniques like quantization can reduce the precision of calculations within EICT, leading to faster processing and reduced memory usage.\n*   **Knowledge Distillation:** This technique could be used to transfer knowledge from a larger, more complex EICT model to a smaller, more efficient one, maintaining performance while reducing computational requirements.\n\n**It is important to note that the effectiveness of these extensions and modifications would depend on the specific details of the EICT framework and its intended application. Careful evaluation and experimentation would be crucial to determine the optimal approach for improving performance.** \n"},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!zip -r 'chroma_db_.zip' 'chroma_db_'"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DXMdL8hwvGpi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713838576717,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":880,"user":{"displayName":"Manchodi Madhusagar","userId":"06706225083011241875"}},"outputId":"2b91abd9-c626-4d12-da80-b27cdf9ad132"},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["  adding: chroma_db_/ (stored 0%)\n","  adding: chroma_db_/chroma.sqlite3 (deflated 40%)\n","  adding: chroma_db_/de3bcfe3-d8bb-49b2-84a7-667753a8e435/ (stored 0%)\n","  adding: chroma_db_/de3bcfe3-d8bb-49b2-84a7-667753a8e435/length.bin (deflated 99%)\n","  adding: chroma_db_/de3bcfe3-d8bb-49b2-84a7-667753a8e435/header.bin (deflated 61%)\n","  adding: chroma_db_/de3bcfe3-d8bb-49b2-84a7-667753a8e435/data_level0.bin (deflated 100%)\n","  adding: chroma_db_/de3bcfe3-d8bb-49b2-84a7-667753a8e435/link_lists.bin (stored 0%)\n"]}]}]}
